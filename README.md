# Lumberjack-Mod-MC-
A mod for Minecraft 1.20.2 that adds a lumberjack to the game, that mines any wood that it comes across. NOTE: If you get the Army Spawner block, you can spawn 5 of the lumberjacks to make an army. To make an army, just click on the block, and then it will spawn a army of lumberjacks near the block.
